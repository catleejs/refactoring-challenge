# Refactoring for Accessibility 

## Code Clean Up

This is a clean up of **existing code https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram**.

### Things I've done:

* Condensed CSS properties (combined)
* Added semantic elements to the HTML file
* Added media queries for accessiblity on all devices
* Added accessibility to the HTML file for easier readability
* Added notes to CSS files via "*/ /*"

### What the working site looks like:
